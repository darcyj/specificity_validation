# Validation scripts for specificity R package 

occupancy_sensitivity: validates that specificity as calculated in the package is NOT sensitive to occupancy or number of observations (or sum of observation values). This is done using global uniform denominator and Rao* for each variable type.

specificity_sensitivity: valudates that specificity (again, global uniform denominator and Rao*) corresponds to specificity as simulated via random multinomial draws.
